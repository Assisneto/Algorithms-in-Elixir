# Anagram Algorithm

1. Check if a string is an anagram of another string

## Resolution

Removing all characters other than letters or numbers, placing all letters in lower case, transforming them into an array, sorting and finally transforming them into a string again. We check if the two strings are identical, if true they are an anagram.

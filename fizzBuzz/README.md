# fizzBuzz Algorithm

1. For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
2. For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, print "Fizz".
3. For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, print "Buzz".

## Resolution

This algorithm was solved using Pattern Matching, where the division is made by both 3 and 5 inside a tuple, and then this same tuple is compared with other tuples that have all possible combinations.
